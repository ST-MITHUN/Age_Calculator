# Age Calculator (Java Practice Project)

##  Project Description

This is a **simple Age Calculator** program built with Java. It takes the user's birth year and calculates their current age.

Part of my **1st Semester practice project** to get hands-on with date/time handling and user input in Java.

##  Features

- Takes birth year as input
- Calculates and displays the current age
- Simple console-based UI

##  Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17)
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- `java.time.Year`

##  Learning Outcome

By building this project, I learned:

- How to take input from the user
- How to work with current date/time in Java
- How to perform simple mathematical calculations
